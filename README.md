This repository contains source code for assembling data on legislation considered (and passed) by the Washington State Legislature.  Initially, the code
just works with data from the 2019 session; we will revise it in 2020 to be more generic.

The code harvests data from the Legislative Service Center's [webservices](http://wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov/), munges the data a bit, and uploads the data
into a data.world [dataset](https://data.world/scottcame/washington-legislature-2019).

Currently available analyses include:

* Cartograms for specific bills (spatial depiction of how Members voted on the bill)
* Party loyalty analyses, including comparison to margin of victory in past election
* Bill survival analysis
